# List Operations in Python

## 📌 Description

This Python script demonstrates **basic list operations** step-by-step.
It starts with an empty list and performs various actions such as adding elements, inserting items at specific positions, extending with another list, removing elements, sorting, and finding the index of a specific value.

The script prints the state of the list after each operation, making it easy to understand how lists work in Python.
